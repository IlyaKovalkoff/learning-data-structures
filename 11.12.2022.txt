Data structures:
1. Classes - contains methods and fields
2. Structures - contains fields

3. Containers(Collections) - contains several elements/objects
    1. Liniear
        1. Tuple/List/Array/Vector - contiguous
            1. Random Access - O(1)
            2. Pushback/Add to the end - O(1)
            3. Insert in the middle - O(n)
            4. Remove - O(n)
        2. Linked List - NOT contiguous, has references to the next element
            1. Random Access - O(n)
            2. Pushback/Add to the end - O(1)
            3. Insert in the middle by index - O(n)
            4. Insert in the middle by iterator/position - O(1)
            5. Remove by index - O(n)
            6. Remove by iterator/position - O(1)
        3. FIFO - First In First Out - Queque
            1. add to the beginning/end - O(1)
            2. remove from the beginning/end - O(1)
        4. FILO/LIFO - First In Last Out - Stack
            1. Push(add) - O(1)
            2. Pop(remove) - O(1)
